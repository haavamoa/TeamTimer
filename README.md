# TeamTimer

![asd](src/TeamTimer.Android/Resources/drawable-xxxhdpi/team_timer.png)

When coaching a team during a football match, you have to keep track of how long a player has played and who should 
substitute. The idea with this app is to manage this for you and keep track of who is the next substitute.

This app can be used for any team sport.
