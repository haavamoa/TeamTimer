# TeamTimer

![asd](src/TeamTimer.Android/Resources/drawable-xxxhdpi/team_timer.png)

TeamTimer is an simple app that can be used to create a team and to track individual timers for each player in the team during a match.

I am using this during my daughter's football matches.

Neat features:
- Substitute a player during a march, the app will keep track of their timers.
- Mark a player as playing/non-playing during the match (Tap-and-hold player in "Match Mode"
- Mark a player as locked/unlocked (Tap-and-Hold player in "Match Mode"
- I have used this when a player is a goalie, because I do not want the lists to put that player in front of the queue.

Feel free to report an issue.
